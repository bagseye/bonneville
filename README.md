  Bonneville - A Gatsby Starter Blog
</h1>

## Please Note

This repo is a WIP. Updates will happen throughout the life of this project as I understand working with Gatsby and React. If issues are raised, I will answer and resolve them when time allows.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using Bonneville
    gatsby new your-new-site-name https://github.com/bagseye/bonneville
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd your-new-site-name/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `your-new-site-name` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
